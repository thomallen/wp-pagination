wp-pagination
=============

This is a WordPress function for pagination. Not your average pagination, but I had a specific need to use a left and right graphic, and move from one custom post type to the next. This funtion uses get_pagenum_link() to let me move back and forth. I'm sure there could be an easier way. Here is an example of how it works.
